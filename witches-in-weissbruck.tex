\chapter{Dramatis Personae}
This chapter provides background and statistics for some of the more important
NPCs who may appear in this adventure. Some of them are central to the plot,
while others may or may not be encountered depending on the heroes' actions.

\section{The Hedge Wizards of Ganttdorf}
Most rural areas of the Empire will be home to at least one Hedge Wizard. These
men and women use traditional and unlicensed magic to serve their communities
by providing medicine and keeping local spirits at bay.

\section{Order of Purifying Flame Chapter House, Weissbruck}
The Witch Hunters' chapter house in Weissbruck currently houses just two
officers. It is normally the base of the district's Witchfinder General and two
permanently assigned Witch Hunters and a number of Interrogators, as well as
offering accommodation for any travelling members of the Order passing through.
A Beastman ambush some months ago killed the previous Witchfinder General and
the other staff, leaving just one Witch Hunter alive. Karina Str{\"o}m had been
left to oversee the district alone until the travelling Inquisitor Lukas Volf
arrived.

\subsection{Lukas Volf}
Lukas Volf is a broad-shouldered Nordlander, of average height but solidly
built. He is in his mid-40s, with short cropped brown hair and a long
moustache. He has been a witch hunter for the last 27 years, currently serving
in the office of Inquisitor. Rather than being bound to a particular district,
his role is to roam the Empire pursuing witches and heretics throughout Sigmar's
realm. He came to Weissbruck several months ago, chasing one of his targets,
but when the district's Witchfinder General was killed by Beastmen he
volunteered to step in and help lead the district.

Unknown to his brother and sister Witch Hunters, Lukas also belongs to a secret
cult within his Order committed to worshipping the Chaos god Khorne for his
hatred of magic users. They exploit the authority of their office to destroy
whole villages, secretly dedicating each witch burning to Chaos while going
through the motions of praying to Sigmar.

``Vater Karl'' by the town's citizens.
