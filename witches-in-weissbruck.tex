\section{The Hedge Wizards of Ganttdorf}
The two hedge wizards are the primary antagonists of the adventure. The first
(Frau Trieste) is presumed to be the target of the PCs' investigation right up
to the point they encounter her, at which point they discover they've been
duped. The real target is her apprentice, Hermann Rauch. The young man has been
consumed by bitterness and jealousy after a young woman in Weissbruck utterly
rejected his advances on the grounds that he was a ``dirty peasant wizard'',
and has been plotting revenge. This wounded pride combined with his magical
talent has given an opportunity for Slaanesh's subtle influence to find its way
into his heart.

\section{Order of Purifying Flame Chapter House, Weissbruck}
The Witch Hunters' chapter house in Weissbruck currently houses just two
officers. It is normally the base of the district's Witchfinder General and two
permanently assigned Witch Hunters and a number of Interrogators, as well as
offering accommodation for any travelling members of the Order passing through.
A Beastman ambush some months ago killed the previous Witchfinder General and
the other staff, leaving just one Witch Hunter alive. Karina Str{\"o}m had been
left to oversee the district alone until the travelling Inquisitor Lukas Volf
arrived.
